How to use all this crud:

(1) Install a bunch of stuff with cabal:

    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ cabal install --dependencies-only

(2) Set up an account at http://www.hamqth.com.  You will need this to do call sign lookups.
    It's easy.

(3) Set up a LOTW account.  Instructions are at http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world.
    This is the world's worst process and takes a week or two (they mail you a postcard)
    but the good news is you can log QSOs without the LOTW account.  You just can't
    run qsoconfirm or qsoupload.

(4) Create a ~/.slog config file.  Mine looks like this:

    database = /home/chris/radio/qsos.db
    qth = Merrimack

    [Lookup]
    username = KG6CIH
    password = <my password here>

    [LOTW]
    username = kg6cih
    password = <my password here>

    [Antennas]
    antennas=Dipole, 1.25m J-Pole, HT

    It's okay if the file referenced by database does not yet exist.  The first time you
    run qsoadd, it will be created.  I highly recomment having a radio/ directory as you
    will start to accumulate a ton of files for using LOTW.  Also, the qth setting needs
    to be the same as the value you give to LOTW.  It's not important for running qsoadd.

(5) Build everything:

    $ cabal build
    $ cabal run slog
