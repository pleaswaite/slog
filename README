How to use all this crud:

(1) Install a bunch of stuff with cabal:

    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ cabal install --dependencies-only

(2) Set up an account at http://www.hamqth.com.  You will need this to do call sign lookups.
    It's easy.

(3) Set up a LOTW account.  Instructions are at http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world.
    This is the world's worst process and takes a week or two (they mail you a postcard)
    but the good news is you can log QSOs without the LOTW account.  You just can't
    run qsoconfirm or qsoupload.

(4) Create a ~/.slog config file.  Mine looks like this (simplified):

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    database = /home/chris/radio/qsos.db
    defaultQTH = Merrimack

    [Lookup]
    username = KG6CIH
    password = <my password here>

    [LOTW]
    username = kg6cih
    password = <my password here>

    [QTH1]
    name = Merrimack
    call = KG6CIH

    antennas = 80m dipole, Lazy H, 1.25m J-Pole
    defaultAntenna = Lazy H

    default_80M = 80m dipole
    default_17M = 80m dipole
    default_1.25M = 1.25m J-Pole

    [Modes]
    default = SSB
    default_30M = PSK31
    default_1.25M = FM

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Here are some rules on the config file:

    * It's fine if the database file referenced does not yet exist.  slog will create it
    for you the first time you run any of the utilities.  I highly recommend having a
    radio/ directory and keep your database in there.  You will start to accumulate a ton
    of files by using LOTW.

    * You need a defaultQTH, and you need at least one QTH* section.  That section header
    name is important.  Within each QTH section, you need a name and a call.  Those must
    match up what you gave to LOTW for your station location.

    * Each QTH can define the antennas in use there and defaults for various bands.  The
    antennas option is a free form list of strings, separated by commas.  This list will
    populate a drop down in the slog GUI.  If you provide no defaultAntenna, the first in
    the antennas list will be used.  When you enter a frequency, any default antenna for
    that band will automatically be chosen.  You can change that later.

    * You need to have at least one antenna defined.

    * Modes are defined globally, not on a per-QTH basis.  The theory behind this is that
    modes are an operator preference, while antennas are whatever you've got wherever you
    are operating from.

    * Just like with antennas, you can define a global default mode and also per-band modes.
    You may only have equipment capable of FM on certain bands, and 30m is digital or CW
    only so you should probably pick one of those.  If no default mode is given, SSB is
    the default.

    * For both modes and antennas, the default names are important.  They all take the form
    of default_<mode>.  Here, <mode> must be something understood by the second element of
    the bandMap tuples in Slog/Formats/ADIF/Types.hs.

(5) Build everything:

    $ cabal build
    $ cabal run slog
