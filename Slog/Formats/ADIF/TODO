Parser --
   - finish stringToField
   - handle user-defined
   - probably want other parse methods, but what?

Types --
   - finish Field, make it do its own Read and Show
   - Location needs to do its own Read

Writer --
   - merge renderField with Show from Field
   - handle user-defined

overall --
   - extensive test suite
   - auto-generate thousands of records and see how fast things are
   - haskell-style documentation
